# California-House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Predicting California house prices using ML. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and regression models (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression, Random Forest, etc.) with performance evaluation and visualizations to explore key factors affecting housing prices.

🏡 California House Price Prediction (KNN)
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices in California using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building to analyze the factors influencing housing prices.

📂 Dataset

Source: California Housing Dataset (commonly used in regression problems)

Features include:

Median income

Housing median age

Average rooms

Population

Latitude & Longitude

Median house value (target)

⚙️ Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature scaling and transformation

Splitting data into train & test sets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis

Feature vs. target visualizations

Outlier detection

Model Building

Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression

Model Evaluation

Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score

Comparison of predictions vs. actual values

📊 Results

KNN regression successfully predicted housing prices with competitive accuracy.

Income and location were found to be the strongest predictors of house prices.
